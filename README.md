# India-Covid-19-Prediction-Model

Covid-19 Prediction Model using various Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models. The goal of this repository is to create a standardized set of data on forecasts from teams making projections of cumulative and incident deaths and confirmed cases due to COVID-19 in India.

## **Overview**

**Data** : https://www.mohfw.gov.in/

Proper **EDA** has been performed for the total number of cases, deaths and recoveries followed by State wise EDA.

**Machine Learning Algorithms Used: ARIMA,Facebook Prophet, Kalman Filter.**

**Deep Learning Models Used: DNN, Vanilla LSTM, Stacked LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, CNN LSTM.**
